      <p>
        If you're reading this, thank you... and I'm really sorry for not saying
        this in person.
      </p>
      <p>Here it goes.</p>
      <p>Truth be told, I'm deeply in love with you.</p>
      <p>Since the first time we met at Kemang Squash, I felt something.</p>
      <p>I tried to keep it to myself, to keep it under control.</p>
      <p>
        Maybe even before that... I couldn't help but think how strange and
        beautiful it was, that two people who both play squash, and who even
        came from the same high school four years apart, somehow crossed paths
        from Bumble.
      </p>
      <p>What are the odds?</p>
      <p>
        That night when I drove you home, I remember you asking me about how
        Bumble was treating me.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, I was afraid... afraid that you would only ever see me
        as a friend.
      </p>
      <p>“But maybe it's too soon,” I told myself.</p>
      <p>
        Days went by, and I couldn't help thinking about you... every day, every
        night.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoyed the time we spent playing squash together, but more than that,
        I cherished our conversations and the moments we shared.
      </p>
      <p>Then one day, I decided to invite you to a shooting game.</p>
      <p>You were up for it</p>
      <p>You had no idea how happy that made me.</p>
