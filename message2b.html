      <p>But I also want to be honest about one thing.</p>
      <p>I do love you.... in a quiet, sincere way.</p>
      <p>Not in a way that demands anything.</p>
      <p>Not in a way that asks you to change or decide anything right now.</p>
      <p>
        So I want to ask you something.... gently, and with no pressure at all.
      </p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>
        Would you ever be open to the idea of us being more than friends
        someday, if and when it feels right for you?
      </p>
