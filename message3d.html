      <p>Regarding your fear of being left or given up on...</p>
      <p>I want you to know that I understand that feeling.</p>
      <p>Maybe more than most people do.</p>

      <p>Right now, as your friend, I just want you to know that I'm here</p>
      <p>and I don't plan on going anywhere.</p>

      <p>
        There's something I'd like to ask, but please don't feel any pressure at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>You don't have to answer now, or even ever, if you don't want to.</p>

      <p>I was just wondering...</p>
      <p>
        would you be open to the idea of us being more than friends someday?
      </p>

      <p>If the answer is no, that's completely okay.</p>
      <p>I truly understand, and I respect you and your feelings.</p>
      <p>
        I know you've been through a lot, and I don't want to add any weight to
        that.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not very good with words, and I know I'd probably mess this up if I
        said it face to face
      </p>
      <p>but I wanted to be honest, and without expectations.</p>
