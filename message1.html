      <p>Hi Janice</p>
      <p>I'm really sorry for the unexpected gift.</p>
      <p>
        I hope you like it, and I hope it doesn't change how you feel about
        fountain pens.
      </p>
      <p>I'm also sorry for giving this to you during a time like this.</p>
      <p>
        At first, I planned to give you this for your birthday, but things
        happened, and I was afraid that if things went south, I wouldn't get the
        chance to give it to you at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        (The same goes for the upcoming Christmas gift... I already have plans
        and ideas for that too.)
      </p>
