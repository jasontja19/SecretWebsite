      <p>Hi Janice,</p>
      <p>I'm really sorry if this website caught you by surprise.</p>
      <p>I hope it doesn't make things feel awkward or different between us.</p>
      <p>
        I was originally planning to send this to you in couple of months, but
        things happened, and I wasn't sure if I'd still get the chance. So I
        thought it might be better to send it to you now.
      </p>
