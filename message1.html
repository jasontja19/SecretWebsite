      <p>Hi Janice,</p>
      <p>I'm really sorry if this gift caught you by surprise.</p>
      <p>
        I hope you like it, and I hope it doesn't make things feel awkward or
        different between us.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was originally planning to give this to you on your birthday, but
        things happened, and I wasn't sure if I'd still get the chance. So I
        thought it might be better to give it to you now.
      </p>
      <p>
        (The same goes for the Christmas gift.... I already had some ideas in
        mind.)
