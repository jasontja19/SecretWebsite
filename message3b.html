      <p>Until that afternoon...</p>
      <p>I hope you didn't realize, but I was heartbroken.</p>
      <p>I went quiet all of a sudden.</p>

      <p>You said that romantic relationships don't come from friendships,</p>
      <p>"Pacaran itu ga bisa dari temen"</p>
      <p>and that platonic relationships should stay platonic.</p>

      <p>Please don't get me wrong... these are just my feelings.</p>
      <p>I understand your stance.</p>
      <p>I understand what you believe in.</p>
      <p>And I truly respect that.</p>

      <p>That day, I questioned myself over and over again.</p>
      <p>“Is this really what I want?”</p>
      <p>“Should I keep moving forward?”</p>
      <p>“...”</p>
      <p>“Should I just give up?”</p>

      <p>There were so many things holding me back.</p>
      <p>So many things to consider.</p>

      <p>The fact that I'm not where I want to be in life yet.</p>
      <p>The fact that you feel so far out of my league.</p>
      <p>The fact that I feel like I have no one.</p>
      <p>The fact that you're surrounded by amazing people.</p>
      <p>
        The fact that you keep encouraging me to fix my Bumble and meet someone
        new.
      </p>
