        I also want to thank you for being honest with me, and for trusting me
        enough to share what you're feeling.
      </p>
      <p>I know that wasn't easy, and I truly appreciate it.</p>
      <p>
        There's something I want to be honest about too.... nothing heavy, just
        something I've been carrying in my thoughts.

        If you'd rather not read it, you can always press "Skip". No pressure at
        all.
