      <p>I can't promise you everything.</p>
      <p>
        I'm still chasing my own dreams, still trying to become a better person.
      </p>

      <p>But I can promise you this</p>
      <p>
        I'll do my best to understand you, to be there for you, and to care for
        you in the ways that I can.
      </p>

      <p>
        And of course, if this isn't something you want, that's completely okay.
      </p>
      <p>I'll still be the same Jason you know.</p>
      <p>
        We can stay friends, just as we are, if that's what you're comfortable
        with.
      </p>

      <p>I think I'm mature enough to handle that...</p>
      <p>or at least, I hope I am.</p>
      <p>And only if you want to.</p>
