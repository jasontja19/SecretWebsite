      <p>But if you're still here… thank you.</p>
      <p>The truth is, I've been holding myself back a little.</p>
      <p>Not because I don't care... but because I do.</p>
      <p>
        When we talked that day, 4th of December, after the shooting game, you
        said that relationships can't really grow from friendships, I took that
        seriously.
      </p>
      <p>"Pacaran itu ga bisa dari temen"</p>
      <p>That moment stayed with me.</p>
      <p>
        It made me step back and really think about where I stand, and what I
        should do with the feelings I have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the truth is, somewhere along the way, I started to care about
        you more than I expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at the same time, I didn't want to assume anything, or put you in a
        position where you'd feel pressured or conflicted.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I chose to hold myself back... not because I don't feel anything, but
        because I respect what you said.
