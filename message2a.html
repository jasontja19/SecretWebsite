      <p>But if you're still here… thank you.</p>
      <p>The truth is, I've been holding myself back a little.</p>
      <p>Not because I don't care.... but because I do.</p>
      <p>
        When we talked that day, 4th of December, after the shooting game, you
        said that relationships can't really grow from friendships, I took that
        seriously.
      </p>
      <p>"Pacaran itu ga bisa dari temen"</p>
      <p>That moment stayed with me.</p>
      <p>
        It made me step back and really think about where I stand, and what I
        should do with the feelings I have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the truth is, somewhere along the way, I started to care about
        you more than I expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        And at the same time, I didn't want to assume anything, or put you in a
        position where you'd feel pressured or conflicted.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I chose to hold myself back.... not because I don't feel anything,
        but because I respect what you said.
      </p>
      <p>And that's where I've been a bit conflicted.</p>
      <p>
        Part of me wants to respect what you've shared and keep things exactly
        as they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another part of me wonders what it would be like if there were space for
        something more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have an answer yet.... and I'm not asking you for one either.
      </p>
      <p>I just wanted to be honest about where I'm at.</p>
      <p>I'm not expecting anything from you.</p>
      <p>I'm not trying to change your mind or rush you into anything.</p>
      <p>I just didn't want to keep pretending that nothing is there.</p>
